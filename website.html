                        <h3>Chris Watson</h3>
                        <p>I joined MIT in the year 2018 through CET exam. Regarding the academic year 2019-2020, almost 80% of the students got placed in various companies. Various companies like Deloitte, IBM, HCF, Amdocs and TATA visit our college every year for placements. Most importantly, our placements cell is associated with 2 different cells, one from MIT-WPU and other from the college itself, so placements rate is high. The previous year, Deloitte company has selected the maximum of the students from our college. It is record-breaking that in a single day, 107 students got placed.</p>
